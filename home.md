> If you're new to this model of voice, it's a great idea to read [this in-depth explanatory guide](/guide) and listen to the clips linked below before continuing to the rest of the archive. The guide provides important context and will help you navigate this resource more efficiently.

The main building blocks of the perceptual model are **size** and **weight**. These are the primary features of the voice that you'll modify, with the goal of altering the degree of *expressed androgenic development* of the voice.

In order to achieve a more typical feminine sound, you'll want to aim for a smaller size and a lighter weight, while keeping them in balance. The opposite goes for masculinization: you'll aim to increase the percieved vocal androgenization by targeting a larger size and a heavier weight while keeping them balanced. *If you're on testosterone, you'll be able to achieve greater masculinization.*

These following clips explain size, weight, and their interactions (**fullness**):

* [Size v2](https://clyp.it/jdquw5ac)
* [Weight](https://clyp.it/nwreza0c)
* [Fullness](https://clyp.it/hu53kin0)

After you've become familiar with size, weight, and fullness, it's a matter of exploring them and finding a configuration that is both comfortable and nice to your ears. If you're getting discomfort or odd qualities such as nasality, the [Purity](/#Purity) section is where you'll want to go.

Additionally, personality-expressing features also matter a lot for gendering voices. These clips below act as an introduction, and more in-depth ones can be found in the [Personality](/#Personality) section. 

* [Personality features vs body features (part 1)](https://clyp.it/hfxzbuw0)
* [Personality features vs body features (part 2)](https://clyp.it/av422l1p)

More information on these topics can be found in their respective sections.
